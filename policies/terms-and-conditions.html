      will not be tolerated. If such incidents are brought to our notice, we
      will give a warning and counsel the candidate. A repeat misconduct will
      lead to the admission being revoked and the student barred from our
      institute. Our courses require a fair amount of dedication from our
      students. Our faculty are committed to your success and will try their
      best to coach and guide you. But if we feel that the student is unable to
      perform or complete the course within the stipulated time, we reserve the
      right to ask the student to leave the course.
