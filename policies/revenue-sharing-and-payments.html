    <h2>Revenue Sharing and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      When an instructor or a publisher hosts a course or an eBook on our
      website and we sell that course or eBook to our students, the revenue
      generated by the paid courses will have 45% revenue share for the company
      and the remaining 55% revenue will be shared with the instructor or the
      publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a student purchases a course or an eBook in India, then it requires us
      to remit sales taxes, good and service tax (GST), or other similar
      transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"), under applicable law, we will
      collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities
      for those sales. If the student purchases the course from outside India
      through Paypal, GST is not applicable, but paypal gateway charges would be
      applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a student purchases a course, we calculate the gross amount of the
      sale as the amount actually received by Tutorials Point from the student
      ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable taxes and payment gateway
      transaction charges are deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale
      ("Net Amount").
    </p>
    <p>
      If we make a sell through our any of our affiliates, we calculate the
      gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Tutorials
      Point from the student ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable
      affiliate commission, taxes and payment gateway transaction charges are
      deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale ("Net Amount").
    </p>
    <p>
      Your revenue share will be 55% of the Net Amount. Tutor or Publisher
      residing in India will have to furnish PAN card details for TDS deduction
      of 10% as per government norms. For Tutor or Publisher based outside
      India, TDS will not be deducted from your revenue share.
    </p>
    <p>
      We process the payments in the first week of every month. Any sell becomes
      mature after its 30 days guarantee period is over. Once a sell is matured,
      we credit the payments of that sell in the first week of the subsequent
      month. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of
      identified fraud, violations of intellectual property rights, or other
      violations of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the following two methods to remit your payments based on your
      locality:
    </p>
